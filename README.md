# KL Lawingco's Personal Site

This is a v2 of my portfolio site, a complete rewrite from v1, written in Typescript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), as a SSG tool. It utilizes [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as well as  [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations.


This contains lots of my details. In future I am planning to get this to cater my own blog too. 

Site is Currently deployed at <b>Netlify</b>'s Free tier .

## Local Development


This is just a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Please use atleast Node v12, but the recommended version is Node v14 LTS.  

## Getting Started

This project heavily favors <b>yarn</b> over npm. 

So to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

and it should open at
